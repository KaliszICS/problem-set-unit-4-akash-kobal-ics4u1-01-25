Deck should not be shuffled upon creation
Constructors should avoid altering the information given to them by removing things and should instead throw an exception if data is invalid.
Avoid throwing exceptions that will already be thrown for you (null cards would get their exception from addCard)
Don't limit your object by placing restrictions on it that don't break your code.  Someone may want to use empty strings, null values or negatives for names/suits/values etc.
Deck should not have a toString method
getCards method should be named getDiscardPile
Otherwise great work!
